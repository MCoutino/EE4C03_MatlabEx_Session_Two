# EE4C03 STATISTICAL DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND MODELING: Exercise Session N.02

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MCoutino/EE4C03_MatlabEx_Session_One/master?filepath=index.ipynb)

Second Matlab exercise session notebook for EE4C03 using the free alternative [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) for scientific computing.

This shows you how to make Octave (Matlab) code to deal with:
1. Generation and analysis of random noise signals
2. Generation and analysis of harmonic signals
3. Generation and analysis of nonstationary signals
4. Design and analysis of elementary digital lters
5. Filtering and analysis of random noise signals

This notebook has been created using the [octave_template](https://github.com/Calysto/octave_kernel) repository.
